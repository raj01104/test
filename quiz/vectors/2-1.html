              <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
              <p>A projectile is an object upon which the only force acting is gravity. There are a variety of examples of projectiles. An object dropped from rest is a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). An object that is thrown vertically upward is also a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). And an object which is thrown upward at an angle to the horizontal is also a projectile (provided that the influence of air resistance is negligible). A projectile is any object that once projected or dropped continues in motion by its own inertia and is influenced only by the downward force of gravity.</p> 

              <br>By definition, a projectile is any object upon which the only force is gravity.

              <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
              <p>Consider a cannonball shot horizontally from a very high cliff at a high speed. And suppose for a moment that the gravity switch could be turned off such that the cannonball would travel in the absence of gravity? What would the motion of such a cannonball be like? How could its motion be described? According to Newton's first law of motion, such a cannonball would continue in motion in a straight line at constant speed. If not acted upon by an unbalanced force, "an object in motion will stay in motion and an object at rest will stay at rest". This is Newton's law of inertia.</p>

              <img src = "u3l2a4.gif">

              <p>Now suppose that the gravity switch is turned on and that the cannonball is projected horizontally from the top of the same cliff. Gravity will act downwards upon the cannonball to affect its vertical motion. Gravity causes a vertical acceleration. The ball will drop vertically below its otherwise straight-line, inertial path. Gravity is the downward force upon a projectile that influences its vertical motion and causes the parabolic trajectory that is characteristic of projectiles.</p>
