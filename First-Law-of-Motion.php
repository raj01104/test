          <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
            <p> <b>An object remains in the state of rest or in uniform motion along a straight line, until it is compelled to change the state by applying external force. </b>
            </p>
            <p>
            It states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This is due to the property of <i>inertia</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Inertia is a property of matter that resists changes in motion. If an object is not moving, it will stay that way until an unbalanced external force starts to move it; if an object is in motion, it will stay in motion with the same speed and direction until an unbalanced external force changes its motion characteristics (friction could slow it down, or a force could accelerate its motion). So, Newton’s first law of motion is sometimes also called the <i>law of inertia</i>.

          <p>
          <ol>
          <li>Consider a car accelerating from a stoplight. As the car accelerates from zero motion, your body tends 
          to push back into the seat due to its inertia (trying to remain at rest). Also, as the car is braked from a 
          high speed back to stopping, your body is flung forward due to its inertia in motion.</li>
          <li>When the pile of coin on the carom-board hit by a striker; coin only at the bottom moves away leaving 
          rest of the pile of coin at same place. This happens because when the pile is struck with a striker, the 
          coin at the bottom comes in motion while rest of the coin in the pile has tendency to remain in the rest 
          and they vertically falls the carom board and remain at same place. </li>
