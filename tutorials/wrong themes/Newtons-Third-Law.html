Newton's Third Law </font></h1>
<p><div style="font-family:Times news roman; font-size: 25px;">
<a name="p2"></a>Newton`s third law of motion states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that it is impossible to exert a force on an object without exerting a force in the opposite direction on some other object.</p>

<p><div style="font-family:Times news roman; font-size: 17px;">
A force is a push or a pull that acts upon an object as a results of its interaction with another object. According to Newton, whenever objects A and B interact with each other, they exert forces upon each other. These two forces are called <em>action</em> and <em>reaction</em> forces and are the subject of Newton's third law of motion. Formally stated, Newton's third law is:</p>

<b><u>Third Law - Action/Reaction</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<b>Newton`s third law of motion</b>
 states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that it is impossible to exert a force on an object without exerting a force in the opposite direction on some other object. When you jump off a bed, the force of your jump pushes the bed downward. When you hit a tennis ball, the strings vibrate or move from the force of the ball. And when a cannon ball is shot out of a cannon, the force that propelled the ball forward is matched with an equal force the moves the cannon in the opposite direction.

<img align="right" height="155" src="img/flyingbird.gif" width="153"><a name="p4"></a>Consider the flying motion of birds. A bird flies by use of its wings. The wings of a bird push air downwards. Since forces result from mutual interactions, the air must also be pushing the bird upwards. The size of the force on the air equals the size of the force on the bird; the direction of the force on the air (downwards) is opposite the direction of the force on the bird (upwards). For every action, there is an equal (in size) and opposite (in direction) reaction. Action-reaction force pairs make it possible for birds to fly.</p>

A fish uses its fins to push water backwards. But a push on the water will only serve to accelerate the water. Since forces result from mutual interactions, the water must also be pushing the fish forwards, propelling the fish through the water. The size of the force on the water equals the size of the force on the fish; the direction of the force on the water (backwards) is opposite the direction of the force on the fish (forwards).
