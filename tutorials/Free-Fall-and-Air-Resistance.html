<a name="p5"></a>If <a href="Newtons-Second-Law.html">Newton's second law</a> were applied to their falling motion, and if a free-body diagram were constructed, then it would be seen that the 1000-kg baby elephant would experiences a greater force of gravity. This greater force of gravity would have a direct affect upon the elephant's acceleration; thus, based on force alone, it <em>might be thought</em> that the 1000-kg baby elephant would accelerate faster. But acceleration depends upon two factors: force and mass. The 1000-kg baby elephant obviously has more mass (or inertia). This increased mass has an inverse affect upon the elephant's acceleration. And thus, the direct affect of greater force on the 1000-kg elephant is <em>offset</em> by the inverse affect of the greater mass of the 1000-kg elephant; and so each object accelerates at the same rate - approximately 10 m/s/s. The ratio of force to mass (F<sub>net</sub>/m) is the same for the elephant and the mouse under situations involving free fall.</p>

<a name="speed"></a>As an object falls through air, it usually encounters some degree of air resistance. Air resistance is the result of collisions of the object's leading surface with air molecules. The actual amount of air resistance encountered by the object is dependent upon a variety of factors. To keep the topic simple, it can be said that the two most common factors that have a direct affect upon the amount of air resistance are the <u>speed of the object</u> and the <u>cross-sectional area of the object</u>. Increased speeds result in an increased amount of air resistance. Increased cross-sectional areas result in an increased amount of air resistance.</p>
