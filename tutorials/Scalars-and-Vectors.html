          <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
            <p> In physics, we can classify quantities as scalars or vectors. Basically, the difference is that a direction is associated with a vector but not with a scalar. 
            </p>
            <p> A <b>scalar</b> quantity is a quantity with magnitude only. It is specified completely by a single number, along with the proper unit. Examples of the scalars are: mass of an object, temperature of an object, distance between two points, time etc…
            </p>
            <p>The addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of scalars follows the rules of ordinary algebra.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand <b>Vectors</b> are physical quantities which requires both magnitude and direction to completely describe them. Examples of the vectors are: force applied on an object, velocity, acceleration, momentum etc…

          <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
            <p>Since vectors are determined by both magnitude and direction, they are geometrically represented by a directed line segment or an arrow. The length of an arrow corresponds to the magnitude of the vector and the direction of the arrow corresponds to the direction of the vector.

          <p>Vectors which have same length  and same direction, are said to be equal vectors.
