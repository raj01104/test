              <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
              <p>A force board or a force table is used such that there are three forces acting upon an object. (The object is the ring in the center of the force board or force table.) In this situation, two of the forces are acting in two-dimensions. A top view of these three forces could be represented by the following diagram.</p> 

              <img src = "img/u3l3a2.gif">

              <p>The goal of a force analysis is to determine the net force and the corresponding acceleration. The net force is the vector sum of all the forces. That is, the net force is the resultant of all the forces; it is the result of adding all the forces together as vectors. For the situation of the three forces on the force board, the net force is the sum of force vectors A + B + C.</p>
              
              <img src = "img/u3l3a3.gif"> 

              <p>One method of determining the vector sum of these three forces (i.e., the net force") is to employ the method of head-to-tail addition. In this method, an accurately drawn scaled diagram is used and each individual vector is drawn to scale. Where the head of one vector ends, the tail of the next vector begins. Once all vectors are added, the resultant (i.e., the vector sum) can be determined by drawing a vector from the tail of the first vector to the head of the last vector. This procedure is shown below. The three vectors are added using the head-to-tail method. Incidentally, the vector sum of the three vectors is 0 Newton - the three vectors add up to 0 Newton. The last vector ends where the first vector began such that there is no resultant vector.</p>

              <img src = "img/u3l3a4.gif">

              <p>The purpose of adding force vectors is to determine the net force acting upon an object. In the above case, the net force (vector sum of all the forces) is 0 Newton. This would be expected for the situation since the object (the ring in the center of the force table) is at rest and staying at rest. We would say that the object is at equilibrium. Any object upon which all the forces are balanced (Fnet = 0 N) is said to be at equilibrium.</p>

              <p>Quite obviously, the net force is not always 0 Newton. In fact, whenever objects are accelerating, the forces will not balance and the net force will be nonzero. This is consistent with Newton's first law of motion.</p>
