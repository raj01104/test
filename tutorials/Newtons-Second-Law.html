<h1><font color="red">
Newton's Second Law </font></h1>
<p><div style="font-family:Times news roman; font-size: 17px;">
<a name="p2"></a>Newton's second law of motion pertains to the behavior of objects for which all existing forces are <u>not</u> balanced. The second law states that the acceleration of an object is dependent upon two variables - the net force acting upon the object and the mass of the object. The acceleration of an object depends directly upon the net force acting upon the object, and inversely upon the mass of the object. As the force acting upon an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is increased. As the mass of an object is increased, the acceleration of the object is decreased.</p>

<p>If a bowling ball and a soccer ball were both dropped at the same time 
        from the roof of a tall building, which would hit the ground with a greater 
        force? Common sense tells us that the bowling ball would. We know that 
        gravity accelerates all objects at the same rate, so both balls would 
        hit the ground at the same time. Therefore the difference in forces would 
        be caused by the different masses of the balls. Newton stated this relationship 
        in his second law,<strong> the force of an object is equal to its mass times 
        its acceleration</strong>.

<a name="Second"></a><a name="p3"></a>Newton's second law of motion can be formally stated as follows:</p>
<div style="font-family:Times news roman; font-size: 17px;">
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
The acceleration of an object as produced by a net force is directly proportional to the magnitude of the net force, in the same direction as the net force, and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.</blockquote>

<a name="p4"></a>In this entire discussion, the emphasis has been on the <em>net force</em>. The acceleration is directly proportional to the <em>net force</em>; the <em>net force</em> equals mass times acceleration; the acceleration in the same direction as the <em>net force</em>; an acceleration is produced by a <em>net force</em>. The NET FORCE. It is important to remember this distinction. Do not use the value of merely "any 'ole force" in the above equation. It is the net force that is related to acceleration. The net force is the vector sum of all the forces. If all the individual forces acting upon an object are known, then the net force can be determined.</p>
