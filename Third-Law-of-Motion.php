          <h5 style = "font-size: 17px; line-height: 23px;">
            <p> <b>Whenever one body exerts a force on a second body, the second body exerts an oppositely directed force of equal magnitude on the first body. 
            <br><center>or</center>
            <br>For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</b>
            </p>
            <p>
            The third law states that all forces exist in pairs: if one object <i>A</i> exerts a force <b>F<sub>A</sub></b> on a second object <i>B</i>, then <i>B</i> simultaneously exerts a force <b>F<sub>B</sub></b> on <i>A</i>, and the two forces are equal and opposite: <b>F<sub>A</sub></b> = -<b>F<sub>B</sub></b>. Therefore, this law is also called action-reaction law, with <b>F<sub>A</sub></b> called the "action" and <b>F<sub>B</sub></b> the "reaction".

          <li>Recoil of gun - When bullet is fired from a gun, the bullet also pushes the gun in opposite direction, 
          with equal magnitude of force. 
          <br>When a gun is fired, it exerts a forward force on the bullet. The bullet exerts an equal and opposite 
          reaction force on the gun. This results in the recoil of the gun. Since the gun has a much greater mass than 
          the bullet, the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet.

          <li>Propulsion of a boat in forward direction – Sailor pushes water with oar in backward direction; 
          resulting water pushing the oar in forward direction. Consequently, the boat is pushed in forward direction. 
          Force applied by oar and water are of equal magnitude but in opposite directions.
