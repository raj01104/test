            <p> An object that is in flight after being thrown or projected is called a projectile. The path of a projectile is called its trajectory. The motion of a projectile may be thought of as the result of two separate, simultaneously occurring components of motions. One component is along a horizontal direction without any acceleration and the other along the vertical direction with constant acceleration due to the force of gravity.</p>
            <p>Some examples of projectiles include:
            <ul> 
            <li>a baseball that has been pitched, batted, or thrown</li>
            <li>a bullet the instant it exits the barrel of a gun or rifle</li>
            <li>a bus driven off an uncompleted bridge</li>
            <li>ball in the air after hitting by the bat</li>
            <li>a runner in mid stride</li>
            <li>the space shuttle or any other spacecraft after main engine cut-off</li>
            </p>
